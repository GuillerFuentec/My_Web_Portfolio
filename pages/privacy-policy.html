            <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about your privacy</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Guillermo Copello (&ldquo;I&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;my&rdquo;) on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information on
                guillermocopello.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the services, features, content, or applications I
                offer (together with the Site, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>I receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the
                Services, through your user account on the Services (your &ldquo;Account&rdquo;); (ii) your use of the
                Services generally; and (iii) from various third-party websites and other services. All defined terms
                not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service, available at
                guillermocopello.com/terms.</p>
            <p>What does our policy cover?</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers my processing of Personal Data that I gather when you are accessing and using
                the Services. As used in this Privacy Policy, &ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo; means any information that can
                be used to individually identify a person, and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; generally covers actions that
                can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage, and disclosure.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy also covers my treatment of any Personal Data that my business partners share with me
                or I share with my business partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third
                parties, and their sites, services, or applications that I do not own or control, or to individuals that
                I do not employ or manage (&ldquo;Third Parties&rdquo;). While I attempt to provide access only to those
                Third Parties that share my respect for your privacy, I cannot take responsibility for the content,
                actions, or privacy policies of those Third Parties. I encourage you to carefully review the privacy
                policies of any Third Parties you access.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident of the European Union, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may
                have additional rights under European Union Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, also known as
                the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) with respect to your Personal
                Data, as outlined below. I may be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the
                Services for purposes of the GDPR. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or whether any of
                the following applies to you, please contact me at copelloguillermo60@gmail.com.</p>
            <p>Note that I may also process Personal Data of my users&rsquo; own customers, end users, or employees in
                connection with my provision of services to customers, in which case I am the processor of Personal Data
                for purposes of the GDPR. If I am the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller) for
                purposes of the GDPR, please contact the controller of your Personal Data (i.e., the user or individual
                providing the course, product, or other offering in connection with which you provided your Personal
                Data) in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>
            <p>What Personal Data does Guillermo Copello Collect From You?</p>
            <p>I collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to me, when third parties
                such as my business partners or service providers provide me with Personal Data about you, or when
                Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of my Services.</p>
            <p>Information I collect directly from you: I receive Personal Data directly from you when you provide me
                with such Personal Data, including without limitation the following:</p>
            <p>First and last name Email address Billing zip code and/or country of residence</p>
            <p>The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and
                JavaScript (collectively, &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and
                tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user
                base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small files &ndash; usually consisting of letters
                and numbers &ndash; placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device
                to visit our Site. We sometimes combine information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data
                with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an
                account with us. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received
                from third parties. Cookies can either be &ldquo;session Cookies&rdquo; or &ldquo;persistent
                Cookies&rdquo;. Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are
                visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas &ldquo;persistent Cookies&rdquo; are stored on your
                device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie
                stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences
                so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you
                visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time. We also use
                persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may
                collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Your browser may offer you
                a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; or &ldquo;DNT&rdquo; option, which allows you to signal to operators of
                websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of
                your online activities over time and across different websites. Because we collect browsing and
                persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means
                that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and
                after you leave our properties. Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide
                information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or
                Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These Cookies
                can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your
                interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others
                believe are relevant to you. We do not control third party Cookies. We use the following types of
                Cookies: Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies that are required for providing you with features or
                services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of
                our Site or Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</p>
            <p>The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and
                JavaScript (collectively, &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;) to enable my servers to recognize your web browser and
                tell me how and when you visit and use my Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about my user base

                Personal Data that I have about you, for example, to tell me who you are or whether you have an account
                with me. I may also supplement the information I collect from you with information received from third
                parties.</p>
            <p>Cookies can either be &ldquo;session Cookies&rdquo; or &ldquo;persistent Cookies&rdquo;. Session Cookies
                are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting my Site or using my
                Services, whereas &ldquo;persistent Cookies&rdquo; are stored on your device for a period of time after
                you leave my Site or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from
                Cookie to Cookie. I use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the
                next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit my Services, how often you
                return, how your use of the Services may vary over time. I also use persistent Cookies to measure the
                effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, I may collect information about your online
                activity after you leave my Services. Your browser may offer you a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; or

                not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that I may collect information about your
                online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave my properties.</p>
            <p>Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to me and third
                parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to my Site or Services, the pages you have
                visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These Cookies can be used to determine
                whether certain third-party services are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget
                advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that I or others believe are relevant to you. I
                do not control third-party Cookies.</p>
            <p>I use the following types of Cookies:</p>
            <p>Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies that are required for providing you with features or services that
                you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of my Site or
                Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</p>
            <p>Functionality Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding my
                Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to my Services. These
                Cookies help me to personalize my content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for
                example, your choice of language or region).</p>
            <p>Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow me to understand how visitors use my
                Site and Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Site, what pages
                visitors view on my Site and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Site. Performance/Analytical
                Cookies also help me measure the performance of my advertising campaigns in order to help me improve my
                campaigns and the Services&rsquo; content for those who engage with my advertising. For example, Google,
                Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services.
                Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
                the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the
                option to opt out of Google&rsquo;s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or
                the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
            <p>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity
                and identify your interests so that I can provide advertising that I believe is relevant to you. For
                more information about this, please see the section below titled &ldquo;Additional information about
                interest-based advertisements.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies. One way you can do this is through your internet
                browser&rsquo;s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will
                prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
                browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can
                also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to
                manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may
                not work.</p>
            <p>To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the &ldquo;preferences&rdquo; or
                &ldquo;options&rdquo; section of your browser&rsquo;s menu. To find our more information about Cookies,
                including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit
                ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/ or allaboutcookies.org.</p>
            <p>Additional information about interest-based advertisements:</p>
            <p>I may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad
                agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These
                advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain
                preferences or behaviors (&ldquo;Interest-Based Ads&rdquo;). Information for Internet-Based Ads
                (including Personal Data) may be provided to me by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular
                users on the Services and/or services of Third Parties. Such information may be gathered through
                tracking users&rsquo; activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish this, I or my
                service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a &ldquo;web beacon&rdquo;) from an ad
                network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated
                auditing, research and reporting for me and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to
                serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to
                view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their
                site.</p>
            <p>Through the Digital Advertising Alliance (&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;) and Network Advertising Initiative
                (&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory
                program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized
                based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from
                participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from
                participating organizations, please visit the DAA&rsquo;s or NAI&rsquo;s consumer opt out pages, which
                are located at networkadvertising.org/choices or aboutads.info/choices. Users in the European Union
                should visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s user information website
                youronlinechoices.eu.</p>
            <p>I do not share your Personal Data with advertisers without your consent. However, if you click on or
                otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a Cookie
                in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.</p>
            <p>How Do I Use Your Personal Data?</p>
            <p>I process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize my Services. For example, I use

                it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</p>
            <p>How and With Whom Do I Share Your Data?</p>
            <p>I share Personal Data with vendors, third-party service providers and agents who work on my behalf and

            <p>I also share information with third parties when you give me consent to do so. Furthermore, if I choose
                to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover,
                if I, or substantially all of my assets, were acquired, or if I go out of business or enter bankruptcy,
                user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and I
                would share Personal Data with the party that is acquiring my assets. You acknowledge that such
                transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of me or my assets may continue to use your Personal Data as
                set forth in this policy.</p>
            <p>How Long Do I Retain Your Personal Data?</p>
            <p>I retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with me or as otherwise
                necessary to provide you Services. In some cases I retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is
                necessary to comply with my legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise
                permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, I retain some information in a
                depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.</p>
            <p>What Security Measures Do I Use?</p>
            <p>I seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type
                of Personal Data and applicable processing activity. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your
                Account and Personal Data by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to
                your device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account.</p>
            <p>I seek to ensure that user account information is kept private. However, I cannot guarantee the security
                of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors,
                may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
            <p>Do I Store the Personal Data of Children?</p>
            <p>As noted in the Terms of Service accessible at guillermocopello.com/terms, I do not knowingly collect or
                solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to
                register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to me. If I learn that I have
                collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, I will delete that information as quickly as
                possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided me Personal Data, please contact me at
                copelloguillermo60@gmail.com.</p>
            <p>What Do Users in the European Union Need to Know?</p>
            <p>Rights Regarding Your Personal Data</p>
            <p>By law, users in the European Union, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland have certain rights

                some circumstances, I may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or
                extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in
                those circumstances, I will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, I may also
                need you to provide me with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to
                verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>

                you can request that I correct or supplement such data by emailing me at copelloguillermo60@gmail.com.

                however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case
                basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary
                to enable you to utilize some or all of my Services.</p>

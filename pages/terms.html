                    amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales
                    taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and

            <ol>
                <li>Arbitration; Class Action Waiver. You agree that all disputes between you and Guillermo Copello or
                    its officers, directors or employees in their capacity as such (whether or not such dispute involves
                    a third party) with regard to your relationship with Guillermo Copello, including without limitation
                    disputes related to these Terms of Service, your use of the Services, and/or rights of privacy
                    and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration in accordance with the
                    streamlined arbitration rules and procedures of JAMS, Inc. then in effect, and you and Guillermo
                    Copello hereby expressly waive trial by jury; provided, however, that to the extent that you have in
                    any manner violated or threatened to violate Guillermo Copello&rsquo;s intellectual property rights,
                    we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the state of New
                    York. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit,
                    and other rights that you and Guillermo Copello would have in court may not be available in
                    arbitration. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &ldquo;small claims&rdquo;
                    court, if permitted by that small claims court&rsquo;s rules and if within such court&rsquo;s
                    jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may
                    bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Guillermo Copello will participate in a class
                    action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. You are
                    giving up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you
                    may have against Guillermo Copello including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of
                    individual arbitrations. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney
                    general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&rsquo;s account,
                    if Guillermo Copello is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be
                    governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the
                    event JAMS, Inc. is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160)
                    days of filing the case, then either Guillermo Copello or you can elect to have the arbitration
                    administered instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall be
                    conducted in the English language. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator
                    will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of
                    Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
                    action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of
                    Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.
                </li>
                <li>30-Day Opt-Out Period. If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver
                    provisions in this Section 15, you must notify Guillermo Copello in writing within 30 days of the
                    date that you first accept these Terms of Service (unless a longer period is required by applicable
                    law). Your written notification must be mailed to Guillermo Copello at the following address: 425 NE
                    22nd St, Miami, FL 33137. If you do not notify Guillermo Copello in accordance with this Section
                    15(b), you agree to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions of these Terms of
                    Service, including such provisions in any Terms of Service revised after the date of your first
                    acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email and mailing addresses and
                    (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Guillermo Copello through
                    arbitration. If Guillermo Copello makes any changes to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
                    section of these Terms of Service (other than a change to the address at which we will receive
                    notices of dispute, opt-out notices, or rejections of future changes to the Arbitration and Clause
                    Action Waiver section), you may reject any such change by sending Guillermo Copello written notice
                    within 30 days of the change to the address set forth in this Section 15(b). This notification
                    affects these Terms of Service only; if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements
                    with Guillermo Copello or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you
                    are opting out of the arbitration provision in these Terms of Service shall not affect the other
                    arbitration agreements between you and Guillermo Copello.</li>
                <li>Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third
                    parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this
                    Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will
                    survive the termination of your relationship with Guillermo Copello.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Limitation of Liability.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, NOR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE
                LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH
                RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
                SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
                WHATSOEVER (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE
                SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) OF the greater
                of (A) fees paid to us for the particular Services during the immediately previous three (3) month
                period or (B) $500.00.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
                York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute
                arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the
                exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Modification.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Guillermo Copello reserves the right, in his sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of
                Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the availability
                of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you
                notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic communication.
                Guillermo Copello may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to
                parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While Guillermo Copello will timely provide
                notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for
                changes. Your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of
                Service constitutes acceptance of those changes, which will apply to your continued use of the Services
                going forward. Your use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service in effect at the time of such
                use.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Miscellaneous.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Entire Agreement and Severability. These Terms of Service (including, for clarity, the Privacy
                    Policy and, where applicable, the EU Data Processing Addendum) are the entire agreement between you
                    and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or
                    contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and
                    us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be
                    unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent
                    necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
                    enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein
                    shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</li>
                <li>Force Majeure. Guillermo Copello shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations
                    hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including,
                    without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.</li>
                <li>Assignment. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or
                    sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. Guillermo Copello may assign, transfer
                    or delegate any of his rights and obligations hereunder without consent.</li>
                <li>Agency. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of
